It’s estimated that Africa needs $3 trillion to transition to green energy – and that it needs to do it fast.  Surely that’s impossible? After all, multinational development banks – like the World Bank – which traditionally lead on this type of investment hold just $1.5 trillion dollars of investment potential. But today’s guest on Africa Daily argues that it can be done, saying the continent’s natural capital – like wind, sun and hydro – could be worth $4.6 trillion by 2030. Alan Kasujja speaks to Dr Hubert Danso, one of a group of financiers in Africa who, between them, control billions of dollars of investments across the continent.
